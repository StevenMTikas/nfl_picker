      *Run Stop Rate: The percentage of run defense snaps where a defender records a stop. 
      *Pressure Rate: The frequency with which a pass rusher pressures the quarterback, including hits, hurries, and sacks. 
      *Pressure Productivity (PFF): A formula that combines pressures (hurries, hits) and sacks to give a comprehensive view of pass-rushing effectiveness.

      *Tackle Probability: An AI-driven metric that measures the likelihood of a defender making a tackle on every play. It quantifies a linebacker's tackling efficiency and identifies potential missed tackles.
      *Run Stop Percentage: This metric tracks how often a linebacker makes a tackle on a running play that prevents the offense from gaining a successful amount of yardage. It is a key indicator of a player's ability to defend against the run.
      *Pressures: Measures the number of times a linebacker hurries, hits, or sacks the quarterback. This statistic is used for players who rush the passer, including blitzing linebackers.
      *Completion Percentage Allowed: For linebackers in pass coverage, this metric measures the percentage of passes completed by a quarterback when targeting the player.
      *Forced Incompletions: An advanced coverage metric that measures how often a linebacker forces an incompletion when targeted.
      *Coverage Grades (PFF): Analytics sites like Pro Football Focus (PFF) assign coverage grades based on a player's performance in pass defense. The Advanced Coverage Grade uses machine learning to grade a player's coverage effectiveness on all plays, not just when they are targeted.
      *Expected Points Added (EPA) and Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA): These comprehensive metrics measure a player's efficiency relative to the league baseline while accounting for situational factors. They show how much a linebacker's performance on a single play or over a season adds to or subtracts from their team's chances of scoring.
      *Defensive Stops: PFF defines a defensive stop as a play where a defender makes a tackle that prevents a successful gain for the offense. This is measured on both running and passing downs.  
    You will generate a ranking of each player and unit, provide a short summary of each unit, and store all research data in the database with each NFL team having its own section containing all players and position group rankings.
